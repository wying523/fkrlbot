# FKRLBot v0.0.4

A bot that helps analyze the readability level of submission titles on Reddit. The bot uses the Flesch-Kincaid formula to determine the readability score.

To run this bot, you must create a `config_bot.py` file that follows the format of `config_skel.py`.

*Note:* Don't run this bot on a default subreddit such as /r/news or /r/all. You will get shadowbanned very quickly. I recommend running the bot on /r/bottesting first.
